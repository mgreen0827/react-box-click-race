## Synopsis

This project is a neat little game I created. Try to get a new high score by clicking the colors to place them in the grid top-bottom and left-right. Your score is based on your accuracy and how long it took to complete.

## Motivation
I wanted some practice with React JSX + ES6, Bootstrap 4, Webpack + Babel

## Installation

Just run npm install and then npm start
